# Oasis (my first ever personal project)

This program is my solution to more efficiently interact with the Channergy e-commerce software. As the company dealt significantly with prison facilities, the structure of the program reflects the nuances of that.

It is a GUI that allows end-users to enter in relevant account information and quickly create new customers or update shipping/billing address information as needed.
